                "Compare the renewability of fossil fuels and biofuels": "Fossil fuels are produced from the fossilisation of plants and animals over millions of years and as such they are considered non-renewable as they cannot be replenished at the rate at which they are consumed. On the other hand biofuels are produced from organic matter at a relatively rapid rate that can be greater than the rate of consumption, making it the more renewable option of the two.",
                "Compare the energy per gram of fossil fuels and biofuels": "The combustion of biofuels will often produce less fuel per gram when comparred to fossil fuels, this is due to the oxygen in biofuels preventing carbon atoms from being fully oxidised",
                "Compare the environmental impacts of fossil fuels and biofuels in regards to net CO2 production": "Biofuels have a much lower net CO2 production than fossil fuels due to the photosynthesis of plants that are used to produce biofuels offsetting the CO2 produced during their combustion.",
                "Compare the environmental impacts of fossil fuels and biofuels in regards to particulate matter": "Biofuels produce much less particulate matter than fossil fuels as they are not contaminated like fossil fuels often are",
                "Compare the environmental impacts of fossil fuels and biofuels in regards to land and resource usage": "Biofuels require a large amount of land and water in order to grow the plants needed to produce biofuel. Fossil fuels on the other hand require extensive drilling and mining to extract the fuels from the Earth. Both are very impactful to local land and wildlife."
